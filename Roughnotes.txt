Installing the live TF2 server

The live version of TF2's dedicated server is required to run a Classified server.

# sudo -Hu srcds bash
$ cd ~
$ . /etc/environment
$ steamcmd
Steam>force_install_dir /home/srcds/tf
Steam>login anonymous
Steam>app_update 232250 validate
Steam>quit

Installing the dedicated server

Ensure you've quit SteamCMD before continuing.

$ cd ~
$ . /etc/environment
$ steamcmd
Steam>force_install_dir /home/srcds/classified
Steam>login anonymous
Steam>app_update 3557020 validate
Steam>quit


Fixing libraries with symlinks

Next we'll need to make some symlinks, since there's some issues with the installed libraries. Your server will not run unless these steps are followed.

First, let's remove the existing libvstdlib.so and replace it with a symlink

$ cd ~/classified/bin/linux64
$ rm libvstdlib.so
$ ln -s libvstdlib_srv.so libvstdlib.so

We'll also need to symlink one of SteamCMD's libraries to a special Steam directory. Note that it's not from within the bin folder.

$ mkdir -p ~/.steam/sdk64
$ ln -s ~/classified/linux64/steamclient.so ~/.steam/sdk64/

Testing the server

Before proceeding, we can manually run the server to make sure the install was successful.

$ cd ~/classified
$ ./srcds.sh -tf_path ~/tf +map ctf_2fort +sv_password changethis
